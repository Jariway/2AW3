                            and culture so unique
                            that it has been protected
                            as a national park and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Perhaps what travelers like
                            best is its almost
                            complete lack of traditional must-see sights such as important artworks, churches, palaces,
                            museums,sculptures
                            and castles. Instead, the ambience and natural beauty are the attractions.
                            Popular things to do include walking the breathtaking paths along the cliffs,
                            pausing over gelato in a café surrounded by candy-colored houses, cooling off with a swim,
                            and just absorbing the Old World charm. .</p>

                            hot-blooded capital is one of the world’s most romantic and inspiring cities.The result of
                            3000 years of ad hoc
                            urban development, Rome's cityscape is an exhilarating spectacle. Ancient icons such as the
                            Colosseum, Roman Forum
                            and Pantheon recall the city’s golden age as caput mundi (capital of the world), while its
                            many monumental
                            basilicas testify to its historical role as seat of the Catholic Church. Lording it over
                            the skyline, St Peter’s
                            Basilica is the Vatican’s epic showpiece church, a towering masterpiece of Renaissance
                            architecture.</p>

                        <p class="card-text textoizda">The romantic city of Venice is located in the Veneto region of
                            Italy — one of the
                            northernmost states. This ancient and historically important city was originally built on
                            100 small islands in the
                            Adriatic Sea. Instead or roads, Venice relies on a series of waterways and canals.

                            One of the most famous areas of the city is the world-renowned Grand Canal thoroughfare,
                            which was a major centre
                            of the Renaissance. Another unmistakable area is the central square in Venice, called the
                            Piazza San Marco. This is
                            where you’ll find a range of Byzantine mosaics, the Campanile bell and, of course, the
                            stunning St. Mark’s
                            Basilica.</p>
